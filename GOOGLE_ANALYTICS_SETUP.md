# Google Analytics Setup for Vercel Deployment

## ‚úÖ What's Been Fixed

The Google Analytics implementation has been completely restructured to work properly with React and Vercel:

### 1. **Removed HTML Script Tags**
- Removed the static Google Analytics code from `public/index.html`
- This approach doesn't work properly with React Router

### 2. **Added React-Specific Implementation**
- Created `src/utils/analytics.js` with proper React integration
- Dynamically loads Google Analytics script
- Tracks page views automatically on route changes
- Includes custom event tracking

### 3. **Environment Configuration**
**Set Environment Variable in Vercel:**
- Variable: `REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID`
- Value: `G-EB1Z519BGJ`
- Analytics only loads in production (not during development)

### 4. **Automatic Tracking**
- **Page Views**: Automatically tracked on every route change
- **Newsletter Signups**: Tracked when users click the newsletter button
- **Blog Views**: Tracked when users view individual blog posts

## üöÄ Vercel Deployment Steps

### Option 1: Environment Variables in Vercel Dashboard
1. Go to your Vercel project dashboard
2. Navigate to Settings ‚Üí Environment Variables
3. Add: `REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID` = `G-EB1Z519BGJ`
4. Redeploy your project

### Option 2: Vercel CLI
```bash
vercel env add REACT_APP_GA_TRACKING_ID
# Enter: G-EB1Z519BGJ
# Select: Production, Preview, Development (or just Production)
vercel --prod
```

## üìä What Will Be Tracked

### Automatic Events:
- **Page Views**: Every page visit
- **Route Changes**: SPA navigation tracking
- **Newsletter Clicks**: Footer newsletter button
- **Blog Post Views**: Individual blog post engagement

### Available Custom Events:
- `trackEvent(action, category, label, value)`
- `trackNewsletterSignup()`
- `trackContactForm()`
- `trackBlogView(postTitle)`

## üîç Verification

After deployment, verify analytics are working:

1. **Real-time Testing**:
   - Visit your live site
   - Check Google Analytics ‚Üí Real-time ‚Üí Overview
   - You should see active users

2. **Debug Mode** (optional):
   - Add `?debug_mode=true` to any URL
   - Open browser dev tools ‚Üí Console
   - You'll see GA debug information

3. **Google Tag Assistant**:
   - Install Google Tag Assistant Chrome extension
   - Visit your site and check for GA tags

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Analytics Still Don't Work:

1. **Check Environment Variables**:
   ```bash
   vercel env ls
   ```

2. **Check Build Logs**:
   - Look for any errors during deployment
   - Ensure the environment variable is available during build

3. **Browser Console**:
   - Open dev tools and check for any GA-related errors
   - Look for network requests to `googletagmanager.com`

4. **Ad Blockers**:
   - Test with ad blockers disabled
   - Some blockers prevent GA from loading

## üìà Enhanced Tracking (Optional)

The setup includes enhanced tracking for:
- User engagement events
- Content interaction
- Newsletter conversion funnel
- Blog content performance

You can add more custom tracking by importing the analytics functions:

```javascript
import { trackEvent } from '../utils/analytics';

// Track custom events
trackEvent('button_click', 'engagement', 'hero_cta');
```

## üéØ Expected Results

After successful deployment:
- Real-time users should appear in GA within minutes
- Page views will be tracked automatically
- Event tracking will show user interactions
- All data will be properly attributed to your GA property

The new implementation is production-ready and optimized for Vercel's deployment environment.
